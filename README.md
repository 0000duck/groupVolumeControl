# groupVolumeControl
Allows users to use keystrokes to Control the volume of a user defined group of programs

**The Problem**
Over time I got tired of adjusting volume for various programs separately. I was playing pc games, while trying to listen to music and chat with friends over VoIP. It was such an annoying task, alt-tab out of the game play with the windows volume mixer sliders alt-tab back in and repeat until i was satisfied. This was a very slow, tedious and annoying solution to volume control. 

**The Solution**
Over the summer I took this problem and developed my own solution using C#, Group Volume Control Utility, the name at the time was not my biggest concern. Basically, this application allows the user to group programs together and control the volume of all the programs in that group with hotkeys assigned by the user that work anywhere in the OS. I grouped mine into categories such as Music, Games, and VoIP. I still use this program today and have been working on it when I have the time so that it can be used more easily by others. It started as a command line program and now has a UI which admittedly needs a more user friendly and cleaner User Interface.

I am working on a system to automate the release of new builds as I compile them,  but for now use the instructions below. If I remember correctly, there are some bugs in that build.

**Installation Instructions**
- 1. Go to the "[ReleaseExecutables(no-merge-allowed)](https://github.com/coder-guy22296/groupVolumeControl/tree/ReleaseExecutables(no-merge-allowed))" and download the zip file.
- 2. Complete instructions can be found on the readme for that branch/
